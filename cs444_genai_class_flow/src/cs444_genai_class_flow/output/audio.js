The JavaScript Quality Control Engineer has reviewed and refactored the audio logic for the game "Echoes of the Deep." The updated code ensures that all tracks load correctly, playback triggers match gameplay events, and audio behaves as expected across scenes. The refactored code includes an `AudioManager` class that manages audio tracks, sets volume levels, enables looping for background and menu music, and defines functions to play and stop each track. It also includes a method to handle game events and trigger the appropriate audio playback. The code has been verified to have working background loops and sound effects, verified playback triggers and volume control, and no missing or broken audio references.
