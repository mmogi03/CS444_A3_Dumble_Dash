- Verified turn order and player actions: The player's turn correctly resets energy, draws cards, and allows card play conditioned on energy.
- Working card behavior and enemy logic: Card effects correctly modify player and enemy states, with the enemy logic effectively reducing player health.
- No logic bugs or flow issues in combat loops: The game loop runs as expected, alternating between player and enemy turns, and appropriately declaring victory conditions.

The test scenario shows the player defeating a single enemy using the given cards and logic, validating that the core gameplay mechanics are functioning properly.
