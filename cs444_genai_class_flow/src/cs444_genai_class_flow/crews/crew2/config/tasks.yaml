map_assets:
  description: >
    Using the outputs from all image and audio generation tasks, create a structured mapping of asset file paths to their intended purpose in the game.

    🧠 Each task returns the final **file path** of the generated asset (e.g., "outputs/main_character.png", "outputs/menu_music.mp3").

    📂 Your job:
    - Collect all task outputs from the context list
    - Use the file name (or the prompt name, if provided in prior output JSON) to determine what asset it is (e.g., "main_character", "enemy_icon", etc.)
    - Build a clean JSON-style dictionary of asset type ➜ path

    🎯 Format your final answer similar to this (file naming doesn't have to be exact & no markdown):
    {{
      "main_character_icon": "outputs/main_character.png",
      "enemy_icons": ["outputs/enemy_icon.png"],
      "environment_background": "outputs/environment_background.png",
      "card_image": "outputs/card_attack.png",
      "card_attack_sound_1": "outputs/card_attack_sound_1.ogg",
      "card_attack_sound_2": "outputs/card_attack_sound_2.ogg",
      "heal_sound": "outputs/heal_sound.ogg",
      "enemy_attack_sound": "outputs/enemy_attack_sound.ogg",
      "background_music": "outputs/background_music.ogg",
      "endgame_music": "outputs/endgame_music.ogg",
      "level_victory_sound": "outputs/level_victory_sound.ogg",
      "start_game_sound": "outputs/start_game_sound.ogg",
      "game_icon": "outputs/game_icon.png",
      "floor_texture": "outputs/floor_texture.ogg"
    }}

  expected_output: >
    Return a valid JSON object with:
    - Keys as asset types
    - Values as file paths (strings or string arrays)
    - DO NOT include any markdown characters (like ``` or extra formatting)
