# ✨ Elven Blight

**Elven Blight** is a 2D infinite crawler and spiritual successor to *DumbleDash* & *ReefEscape*. You play as a **brave elf warrior** on a mission to rescue your **captured elf princess**, traversing through the mystical but deadly enchanted forest. With blade and bow, you must fight off twisted woodland creatures, evil elves, and gooey monsters while calling upon the power of nature to survive.

Your goal: survive as long as possible in classic roguelike fashion, while progressing through increasingly dangerous biomes to find and free your princess.

## 🕹️ How to Run the Game in Your Browser

This game runs in a web browser, but you **cannot** open `index.html` directly by double-clicking it. Modern browsers block local file access for security reasons.

To run *Elven Blight* correctly, you'll need to serve the game using a local development server. Here are a few easy options:

### ✅ Option 1: Use `http-server` with `npx` (No install required)

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root folder of the game:

   ```
   cd ElvenBlight
   ```
3. Run this command:

   ```
   npx http-server
   ```
4. You’ll see a local URL like `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.
   Open it in your browser to play the game.

If you don’t have `npx`, you can install it by installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), which includes `npx` by default.

---

### ✅ Option 2: Use Live Server in Visual Studio Code

1. Open the `ElvenBlight` folder in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Install the **Live Server** extension:

   * Go to the Extensions tab (or press `Ctrl+Shift+X`)
   * Search for **Live Server**
   * Click **Install**
3. Right-click on `index.html` in the file explorer.
4. Click **"Open with Live Server"**.
5. Your default browser will open and load the game automatically using a local server (usually at `http://127.0.0.1:5500`).

---

### ✅ Option 3: Use Live Share with Go Live (for Collaboration or Demos)

1. Install the following extensions in Visual Studio Code:

   * **Live Share**
   * **Live Server**
2. Start a **Live Share** session.
3. Within the shared session, right-click `index.html` and choose **"Open with Live Server"**.
4. Share the session link with others — they’ll be able to view and play the game in their own browsers using your live server.
