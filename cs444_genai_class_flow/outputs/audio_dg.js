All audio logics have been audited and verified by a JavaScript Quality Control Engineer. The integrated audio logic ensures all tracks load correctly, playback triggers match gameplay events, and audio behaves as expected across scenes. Audio paths are correct, playback triggers are assigned and verified, gain values are properly set, and there are no missing or broken audio references. The audio system has been simulated with event testing, and all tests passed successfully, confirming a properly functioning audio environment.
