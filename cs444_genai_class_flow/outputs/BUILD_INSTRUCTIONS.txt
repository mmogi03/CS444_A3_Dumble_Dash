Details:
--------
The game files have been bundled using Webpack. The entry point is `src/index.js` where the main JavaScript logic is coded. The `src/style.css` is used for styling, and all static assets are included under the `assets/` folder.

1. **index.html**: The main HTML file structured to work with bundled JavaScript and CSS.
2. **style.css**: This file contains all necessary styles for the game interface.
3. **bundle.js**: Contains all compiled logic for initializing and running the game, integrated from the main.js logic provided.
4. **assets/**: All images and audio files are placed here, bundled with hashed file names for cache efficiency.

The `webpack.config.js` defines the rules for processing JavaScript, CSS, and asset files, and ensures the final output resides in the `dist/` directory.

The setup done delegates the hard work of building sources to the Web Game Build Engineer, ensuring all components are correctly processed and placed in the output directory ready for deployment. Deploy this `dist/` folder to your web server to make the game live in the browser. Make sure to preserve the directory structure to maintain asset linking.
