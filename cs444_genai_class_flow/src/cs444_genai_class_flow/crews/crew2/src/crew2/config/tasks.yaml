    📂 This includes:
    - Character and enemy icons
    - Environmental backgrounds and visual effects
    - Menu, background, victory, and defeat music

    🧠 Use the output strings to find:
    - File names
    - Prompt used (if available)
    - What part of the game the asset is tied to

    🎯 Output format: JSON-like mapping of asset roles to file paths, such as:
    {{
      "main_character_icon": "outputs/dalle_image_xyz.png",
      "enemy_icons": ["outputs/dalle_image_abc.png", "outputs/dalle_image_def.png"],
      "environment_background": "outputs/dalle_image_ghi.png",
      "trap_effect": "outputs/dalle_image_jkl.png",
      "menu_music": "outputs/menu_track_123.mp3",

      "game_icon": "outputs/game_icon_xyz.png"
    }}

  expected_output: >
    A structured JSON object with all relevant file paths and asset types needed by the dev team to build the game.
    Follow the Outut format example in the description and do NOT include any markdown characters such as '```'.
