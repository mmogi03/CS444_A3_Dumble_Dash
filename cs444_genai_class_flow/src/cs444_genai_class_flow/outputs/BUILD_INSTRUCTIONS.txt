The game project has been successfully packaged using Webpack. The directory structure is as follows:

│   ├── bundle.js
│   └── index.html
├── src
│   ├── assets
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── main.js
│   └── style.css
├── package.json

```

To build the project, run `npm install` to install dependencies and then `npm run build` to generate the `dist` directory with all bundled files ready for deployment. The `dist` directory contains `index.html`, `bundle.js`, and an `assets/` folder, making it ready to be deployed in the browser.
