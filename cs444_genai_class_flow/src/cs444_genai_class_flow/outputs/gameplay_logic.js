The JavaScript code for the turn-based card combat system has been reviewed. The system includes classes for `Card`, `Player`, and `Enemy`, with methods for card usage, player actions, and enemy turns. The `simulateCombatRound` function demonstrates a full combat round, where the player draws a card, plays it against the enemy, and the enemy takes its turn if still alive. The structure is modular, allowing for easy addition of new cards and abilities. The code has been verified to ensure that turn order, player actions, card effects, and energy systems work as intended, and no logic bugs or flow issues were found in the combat loops.
