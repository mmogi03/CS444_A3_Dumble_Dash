The game "Forbidden Tomes: Odyssey of the Arcane" has been successfully packaged into a single deployable JavaScript bundle. The directory structure includes organized assets and modules, ensuring the game runs independently in a browser. The game starts automatically when the script is loaded, with all components (UI, logic, scenes, audio) properly connected. The directory structure is as follows:

```
/ForbiddenTomes
    /assets
        /audio
        /images
    /modules
        Card.js
        Player.js
        Enemy.js
        GameLogic.js
        AudioManager.js
        UI.js
    index.html
    styles.css
    bundle.js
```

The game is ready to be deployed and run as a standalone application.
