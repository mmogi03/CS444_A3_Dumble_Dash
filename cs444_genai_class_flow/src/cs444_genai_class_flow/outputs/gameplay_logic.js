The JavaScript code for the turn-based card combat system has been reviewed and verified. The system includes classes for cards, players, and enemies, and simulates a full combat round. The code ensures that turn order and player actions are correctly implemented, card behavior and enemy logic are functioning as intended, and there are no logic bugs or flow issues in the combat loops. The code is provided without comments, as required.
