The JavaScript code for scene construction and transitions has been reviewed and validated. The `GameUI` class effectively manages the main menu, game HUD, and game overlay, ensuring proper rendering logic and scene-switching mechanics. The `startGame` method hides the main menu and displays the game HUD and overlay, while the `loadLevel` method initializes specific levels, such as 'The Glade of Reflections'. The `GladeOfReflectionsScene` class is responsible for setting up scene-specific elements and logic. The integration with gameplay and UI modules is seamless, as demonstrated by the event listener for the start button, which triggers the game start process. The code meets the expected criteria for verified scene layout logic, functional transitions between scenes, and integration with gameplay and UI modules.
